# 🔄 Simon Says - MSP430G2553

A minimal and efficient implementation of the classic Simon Says memory game, built for the **MSP430G2553** microcontroller.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project recreates the Simon Says game using a 128x128 pixels LCD screen, a joystick, and a buzzer.  
It is designed to run on a **low-memory MSP430G2553**, demonstrating how clean and compact embedded code can implement complex behavior within tight resource limits.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Clean and well-documented C code.
- ✅ Optimized for size and memory: fits entirely within the MSP430G2553's limits.
- ✅ Implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to handle:
  - Game logic
  - Input validation
  - Scoring
  - Random sequence generation
- ✅ Visual (LCD) and audio (buzzer) feedback.
